/**
* \addtogroup group_sysint
* \{
* The SysInt driver provides an API to configure the device peripheral interrupts.
* It provides a lightweight interface to complement
* the <a href="https://www.keil.com/pack/doc/CMSIS/Core/html/group__NVIC__gr.html">CMSIS core NVIC API</a>.
* The provided functions are applicable for all cores in a device and they can
* be used to configure and connect device peripheral interrupts to one or more
* cores.
*
* The functions and other declarations used in this driver are in cy_sysint.h.
* You can include cy_pdl.h (ModusToolbox only) to get access to all functions
* and declarations in the PDL.
*
* \section group_sysint_vector_table Vector Table
* The vector table defines the entry addresses of the processor exceptions and
* the device specific interrupts. It is located at the start address of the flash
* and is copied by the startup code to RAM. The symbol code __VECTOR_TABLE is the
* address of the vector table in the startup code and the register SCB->VTOR
* holds the start address of the vector table. See \ref group_system_config_device_vector_table
* section for the implementation details.
*
* The default interrupt handler functions are defined as weak functions to a dummy handler
* in the startup file. The naming convention is \<interrupt_name\>_IRQHandler.
* Defining these in the user application allows the linker to place them in
* the vector table in flash. For example:
* \code
* void ioss_interrupts_gpio_0_IRQHandler(void)
* {
*     ...
* }
* \endcode
* And can be used like this:
* \snippet sysint/snippet/main.c snippet_Cy_SysInt_flashVT
* Using this method avoids the need for a RAM vector table. However in this scenario,
* interrupt handler re-location at run-time is not possible, unless the vector table is
* relocated to RAM.

* \section group_sysint_driver_usage Driver Usage
*
* \subsection group_sysint_initialization Initialization
*
* Interrupt numbers are defined in a device-specific header file, such as
* cy8c68237bz_ble.h, and are consistent with interrupt handlers defined in the
* vector table.
*
* To configure an interrupt, call Cy_SysInt_Init(). Populate
* the configuration structure (\ref cy_stc_sysint_t) and pass it as a parameter
* along with the ISR address. This initializes the interrupt and
* instructs the CPU to jump to the specified ISR vector upon a valid trigger.
* All the supported interrupts are listed in \ref IRQn_Type.
* The priority of these interrupts is determined by the
* interrupt number (index in the \ref IRQn_Type enumeration).
*
* \subsection group_sysint_enable Enable
*
* After initializing an interrupt, use the CMSIS Core
* <a href="https://www.keil.com/pack/doc/CMSIS/Core/html/group__NVIC__gr.html#ga530ad9fda2ed1c8b70e439ecfe80591f">NVIC_EnableIRQ()</a> function
* to enable it. Given an initialization structure named config,
* the function should be called as follows:
* \code
* NVIC_EnableIRQ(config.intrSrc)
* \endcode
*
* \subsection group_sysint_service Writing an interrupt service routine
*
* Servicing interrupts in the Peripheral Drivers should follow a prescribed
* recipe to ensure all interrupts are serviced and duplicate interrupts are not
* received. Any peripheral-specific register that must be written to clear the
* source of the interrupt should be written as soon as possible in the interrupt
* service routine. However, note that due to buffering on the output bus to the
* peripherals, the write clearing of the interrupt may be delayed. After performing
* the normal interrupt service that should respond to the interrupting
* condition, the interrupt register that was initially written to clear the
* register should be read before returning from the interrupt service routine.
* This read ensures that the initial write has been flushed out to the hardware.
* Note, no additional processing should be performed based on the result of this
* read, as this read is intended only to ensure the write operation is flushed.
*
* This final read may indicate a pending interrupt. What this means is that in
* the interval between when the write actually happened at the peripheral and
* when the read actually happened at the peripheral, an interrupting condition
* occurred. This is ok and a return from the interrupt is still the correct
* action. As soon as conditions warrant, meaning interrupts are enabled and
* there are no higher priority interrupts pending, the interrupt will be
* triggered again to service the additional condition.
*
* \section group_sysint_section_configuration_considerations Configuration Considerations
*
* Below is an example of typical interrupt configuration:
