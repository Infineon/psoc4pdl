# PSoC 4 Peripheral Driver Library - Alpha

**Alpha Release Content** - Support for PSoC 4 family of devices on ModusToolbox
is currently in alpha. Features may change without notice. Contact
[Cypress Support](https://www.cypress.com/support) for additional details.

## Overview

The Cypress PDL simplifies software development for PSoC 4 family of devices.
The PDL integrates device header files, startup code, and
peripheral drivers into a single package. The drivers abstract the hardware
functions into a set of  easy-to-use APIs. These are fully documented in the
[PDL API Reference Manual](https://cypresssemiconductorco.github.io/psoc4pdl/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/index.html).

## Features

The PDL reduces the need to understand register usage and bit structures,
thus easing software development for the extensive set of peripherals in the
PSoC 4 series.
See the [PDL Release Notes](./RELEASE.md) for release-specific information.

## Peripheral Drivers

The PDL provides a high-level API to configure, initialize, and use a peripheral
driver. The drivers are designed for peripheral IP blocks.
See [PDL API Reference Manual](https://cypresssemiconductorco.github.io/psoc4pdl/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/modules.html)
for the list of drivers.

## Quick Start

See the [PDL API Reference Manual Getting Started](https://cypresssemiconductorco.github.io/psoc4pdl/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/page_getting_started.html)
section for quick start instructions.
